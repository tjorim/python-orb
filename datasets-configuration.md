# Datasets Configuration

[Datasets](/docs/deploy-and-configure/datasets) can be configured on a per-Orb basis in the [Orb Cloud Status page](https://cloud.orb.net/status) or via Deployment Tokens in the [Orchestration page](https://cloud.orb.net/orchestration). For more details on configuration, see [Remote Configuration](/docs/deploy-and-configure/configuration#remote-configuration)

You can configure which Datasets your Orbs generate, where they are sent, and enable the inclusion of potentially [Identifiable](/docs/deploy-and-configure/datasets-configuration#identifiable-information) yet useful information (e.g. IP address).

Datasets Configuration requires Orb app and sensor versions 1.3 and above.

## Identifiable Information

Identifiable Information is information that can potentially be used to identify an individual (e.g. public IP address, network name). By default, this information is masked, hashed, or not sent. If you want access to Identifiable Information, you must explicitely enable it via configuiration. Currently, the following fields are classified as "identifiable": `orb_name, device_name, network_name, public_ip, latitude, longitude`. For more information, see [Datasets](/docs/deploy-and-configure/datasets) and note the fields containing `identifiable=true`.

## Disable Orb Cloud Data

You may choose to not send Datasets to Orb Cloud. To prevent your Orb from sending data to Orb Cloud, simply update the configuration to have an empty array as the value of the `datasets.cloud_push` key. For example:

```json
{
  "datasets.cloud_push": []
}
```

Would generate no Datasets and send no Datasets to Orb Cloud. Orb Cloud will still be used to manage your subscription entitlements and Orb configuration.

See [Remote Configuration](/docs/deploy-and-configure/configuration#remote-configuration) for details on editing your configuration.

## Local API

Local API allows you to configure an Orb to serve a local HTTP endpoint that can be used to access datasets with polling (recurring) requests. The response payloads will contain an array of JSON objects with each key described in the [Datasets](/docs/deploy-and-configure/datasets) documentation.

You can build a powerful analytics experience for your home lab with complete control, or equip an IoT display with information about your connectivity. All of this for free!

You can either configure/build your own receiver listener, or use the open source and well supported [Telegraf](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/telegraf/) collector with the [HTTP input plugin](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2/write-data/no-code/use-telegraf/use-telegraf-plugins/use-http-plugin/).

The easiest way to get started with Orb Local API is using our Orb [Local Analytics](/docs/deploy-and-configure/local-analytics) open source project.

#### Configuration options

- `port` - Port on which Data API server will start (default: `7080`)
- `identifiable` - Whether to include Identifiable Information (default: `false`)
- `buffer` – Maximum in-memory records to retain (default: `100`)

#### Example configuration

```json
{
  "datasets.api": [
    "identifiable=true",    
    "port=7080",
    "scores_1m",
    "responsiveness_1s",
    "speed_results",
    "web_responsiveness_results"
  ]
}
```

See [Remote Configuration](/docs/deploy-and-configure/configuration#remote-configuration) for details on editing your configuration.

#### Accessing the API

To get data from Local Data API, callers should poll the GET API to fetch new dataset records since the last request. To keep track of which records have already been received and only fetch new records, the caller should use its own unique `caller_id` that is consistent across polling requests.

```
GET /api/v2/datasets/{name}.{format}?id={caller_id}
```

**Parameters:**

- `name` - Name of a configured dataset (e.g. `"responsiveness_1s"`,  `"speed_results"`)
- `caller_id` - Unique ID of caller, to allow API to ensure only new records are served and no duplicates from previous polling requests are served. This can be any string, so a collecting process can generate a random string if desired. If you know there will only be one calling process/destination, you can use a static/consistent ID like `id=123`.
- `name` - Format extension (`json` or `jsonl`) for JSON (array) response or NDJSON (line separated objects) response payload

**Example:**

```
GET http://localhost:7080/api/v2/datasets/responsiveness_1s.json?id=123
```

**Example Response:**

```json
